\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

The experiment shows a superior performance on modularity quality metric to the new algorithm as compare to the naive clustering algorithm in the regime where number of clusters are large as it exploits the neighbourhood information rather than the node embedding only. Additionally, the new algorithm introduces a reasonable time complexity on the matching between new graph snapshot clustering and the reference clustering.

For future work, there should be modification on \emph{ddCRP} to adopt different cluster size distributions. Many other decay functions are possible to be experimented for better performance. The \emph{MCLA} matching scheme is still in its initial version, there is not any quality metric to measure its matching performance. The matching performance is still greatly dependent on the performance of the clustering algorithm.
