This project describes: a novel graph clustering algorithm that is an efficient extension of the Gibbs sampling under \emph{distance dependent Chinese Restaurant Process, ddCRP} \cite{blei2011distance} for graph, a general cluster ensemble and cluster matching algorithm based on the concept of \emph{Meta-Graph} \cite{strehl2002cluster}, an algorithm pipeline to tackle the dynamic graph clustering problem, intensive experiments to measure performance of the new algorithms.
